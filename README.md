# Basic-Robotics
This repository provides key robotics algorithms, including kinematics, dynamics, planning, and control, with many based on [Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control](https://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/7/7f/MR.pdf) which I call them [basic algorithms](https://github.com/cc299792458/Classic-Robotics-Algorithms/tree/main/basic_algos). This is an excellent book that explains many concepts with just the right amount of detail. It covers a comprehensive range of topics and presents them in a highly concise manner, making it an outstanding introductory book for learning robotics.

Robotics is a discipline that encompasses a vast array of knowledge, making it quite challenging for newcomers. **Robotics is fascinating. I hope this repository can help beginners in gaining a better understanding of robotics concepts.**
