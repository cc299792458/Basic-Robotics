**Trapezoidal Motion Profiles**

Trapezoidal Motion Profiles are a simple yet effective approach for motion planning, often used when a balance between smoothness and simplicity is needed. The profile consists of three phases: acceleration, constant velocity, and deceleration, forming a trapezoidal shape when plotting velocity over time. This method allows for straightforward control of maximum velocity and acceleration, making it ideal for applications where precise and rapid movements are required, such as in industrial robotics. However, the abrupt changes in acceleration at the transitions can introduce mechanical stress, which is a trade-off for its simplicity.
